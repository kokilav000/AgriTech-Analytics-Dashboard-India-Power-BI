# AgriTech-Analytics-Dashboard-India-Power-BI

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze Indian agricultural data with a focus on crop yield, production trends, regional performance, and seasonal patterns. The objective of this project is to demonstrate how data analytics and visualization can provide actionable insights to support decision-making in the agriculture sector.

The data was processed and cleaned using Power Query, with calculations and measures built using DAX. The dashboard highlights key metrics such as top-performing crops, supply-demand trends, and seasonal yield patterns, while also offering drill-through capabilities and interactive filters for deeper analysis.

By simplifying complex datasets into meaningful visuals, the AgriTech Analytics Dashboard makes agricultural trends easier to understand and enables more informed planning and strategy. This project also showcases practical applications of Power BI, Power Query, and DAX in building end-to-end analytics solutions.
